## Problem Documentations so far

- [x] [Problem 1](
      Finding out having to setup an environment (on Mac) with python to get Django installed. The solution was to run "python3 -m venv env" to create a virtual environment and then run "source env/bin/activate" to activate the virtual environment. After that, I was able to install Django using "pip install django".
      )

- [x] [Problem 2](
      Setting up the url listing for the frontend with React where Django serves the frontend as an app. I forgot that I had to add the url listing for the frontend in the urls.py file in the Django app.
      )

- [x] [Problem 3](
      Getting in to the backend of Django via the browser. Solution: create a superuser using "python manage.py createsuperuser" and then login to the admin page using the superuser credentials.
      )
